# Code Review: Habitats Feature

## Overview

The Habitats feature is the core social functionality of Zoovie, implementing a comprehensive system for movie/TV fan communities. The feature includes habitat management, real-time chat, discussions, polls, and watch parties. The implementation follows a clean architecture pattern with clear separation between data access, business logic, and presentation layers.

## Strengths

### 1. **Excellent Architecture & Separation of Concerns**

- **Clean layered architecture**: Clear separation between repository (data access), service (business logic), and components (presentation)
- **Domain-driven design**: Well-defined types and schemas in the domain layer
- **Consistent error handling**: Centralized error normalization and user-friendly error messages
- **Modular component structure**: Shared components are properly extracted and reusable

### 2. **Robust Data Validation & Type Safety**

- **Comprehensive Zod schemas**: Excellent validation for all user inputs with detailed error messages
- **Strong TypeScript typing**: Well-defined interfaces for all data structures
- **Input sanitization**: Proper message content validation and sanitization in the service layer
- **Database constraint alignment**: Validation rules match database constraints (e.g., 1000 char message limit)

### 3. **Professional Error Handling**

- **Centralized error mapping**: `error-map.ts` provides consistent, user-friendly error messages
- **Proper error normalization**: `normalize-error.ts` handles Supabase, Zod, and custom errors uniformly
- **Graceful error recovery**: Components handle errors with retry mechanisms and clear user feedback
- **Business logic validation**: Service layer enforces access control and business rules

### 4. **Real-time Functionality**

- **Sophisticated real-time chat**: `useRealtimeChat` hook with connection management and auto-reconnection
- **Proper connection lifecycle**: Handles connection states, errors, and cleanup
- **Message deduplication**: Prevents duplicate messages from real-time updates
- **Optimistic updates**: Messages appear immediately while being sent

### 5. **Component Design Excellence**

- **Consistent shared components**: `LoadingState`, `ErrorState`, `EmptyState` provide uniform UX
- **Proper component composition**: Components are focused and composable
- **Accessibility considerations**: Semantic HTML and proper ARIA attributes
- **Design system compliance**: Uses Shadcn UI components and design tokens

## Areas for Improvement

### 1. **Performance & Scalability Concerns**

#### Database Query Optimization

```typescript
// ISSUE: N+1 query potential in repository
async getDiscussionsByHabitat(habitatId: string): Promise<DiscussionWithStats[]> {
  // This could be optimized with a single query using aggregations
  const { data: discussions, error } = await supabase
    .from("habitat_discussions")
    .select(`
      *,
      message_count:habitat_messages(count),
      last_message:habitat_messages(created_at)
    `)
}
```

**Recommendation**: Use database views or stored procedures for complex aggregations to reduce query complexity and improve performance.

#### Memory Management

```typescript
// ISSUE: Potential memory leak in useRealtimeChat
const [state, setState] = useState<UseRealtimeChatState>({
  connected: false,
  connecting: false,
  error: null,
});
```

**Recommendation**: Consider implementing message pagination and cleanup for long-running chat sessions to prevent memory bloat.

### 2. **Code Duplication & Maintenance**

#### Repeated Validation Logic

```typescript
// ISSUE: UUID validation repeated across multiple components
const isValidUUID = (id: string): boolean => {
  const uuidRegex =
    /^[0-9a-f]{8}-[0-9a-f]{4}-[1-5][0-9a-f]{3}-[89ab][0-9a-f]{3}-[0-9a-f]{12}$/i;
  return uuidRegex.test(id);
};
```

**Recommendation**: Extract to a shared utility function in `/src/utils/validation.ts`.

#### Similar Hook Patterns

The `useHabitatMessages` and `useDiscussionMessages` hooks share significant logic that could be abstracted into a base hook.

### 3. **Business Logic Complexity**

#### Service Layer Responsibilities

```typescript
// ISSUE: Service methods are becoming large and handling multiple concerns
async getDashboardData(habitatId: string, userId: string): Promise<HabitatDashboardData> {
  // 50+ lines of logic mixing data fetching, access control, and data transformation
}
```

**Recommendation**: Break down large service methods into smaller, focused functions. Consider introducing a separate access control service.

#### Access Control Scattered

Access control logic is repeated across multiple service methods. Consider centralizing this into a dedicated access control service.

### 4. **Error Handling Edge Cases**

#### Incomplete Error Coverage

```typescript
// ISSUE: Some error scenarios not handled
private async updateMemberCount(habitatId: string): Promise<void> {
  // What happens if count query succeeds but update fails?
  // No rollback mechanism for partial failures
}
```

**Recommendation**: Implement proper transaction handling for multi-step operations.

### 5. **Real-time Connection Reliability**

#### Connection State Management

```typescript
// ISSUE: Complex connection state management could be simplified
const connect = useCallback(
  async () => {
    // 100+ lines of connection logic with multiple state updates
  },
  [
    /* many dependencies */
  ]
);
```

**Recommendation**: Consider using a state machine library (like XState) for complex connection state management.

### 6. **Component Coupling**

#### Tight Coupling to Routing

```typescript
// ISSUE: Components directly manipulate router
const handleHabitatClick = (habitatId: string) => {
  router.push(`/habitats/${habitatId}`);
};
```

**Recommendation**: Pass navigation handlers as props to make components more reusable and testable.

## Security Considerations

### 1. **Access Control Implementation**

- ✅ **Good**: Proper access validation in service layer
- ✅ **Good**: User role checking for habitat ownership
- ⚠️ **Concern**: Access control logic is scattered and could be centralized

### 2. **Input Sanitization**

- ✅ **Good**: Comprehensive input validation with Zod
- ✅ **Good**: Message content sanitization
- ⚠️ **Concern**: Consider additional XSS protection for rich content

### 3. **Data Exposure**

- ✅ **Good**: Proper filtering of sensitive data
- ⚠️ **Concern**: Ensure user profiles don't expose sensitive information in chat

## Recommendations for Future Development

### 1. **Immediate Improvements (High Priority)**

1. **Extract shared utilities**: Create `/src/utils/validation.ts` for UUID validation and other common validations
2. **Centralize access control**: Create `AccessControlService` to handle all permission checks
3. **Optimize database queries**: Review and optimize queries with high complexity
4. **Add transaction support**: Implement proper rollback for multi-step operations

### 2. **Medium-term Enhancements**

1. **Implement caching**: Add Redis or in-memory caching for frequently accessed data
2. **Add monitoring**: Implement error tracking and performance monitoring
3. **Improve real-time reliability**: Add connection health checks and better error recovery
4. **Component testing**: Add comprehensive unit tests for complex components

### 3. **Long-term Architecture**

1. **Consider microservices**: As the feature grows, consider splitting into smaller services
2. **Implement event sourcing**: For audit trails and better data consistency
3. **Add offline support**: Implement offline-first architecture for better UX
4. **Performance optimization**: Implement virtual scrolling for large message lists
