## Implementation Notes

### Reusing Existing Code

1. **TMDB Integration**: Use existing `src/features/ai-chat/utils/tmdb-tools.ts` and `src/app/api/tmdb/repository.ts`
2. **Watch History**: Leverage existing `src/features/profile/data/watch-history.repository.ts`
3. **Friends System**: Build on existing `src/features/profile/data/friends.repository.ts`
4. **API Patterns**: Follow existing patterns in `src/app/api/profiles/[userId]/route.ts`
5. **Card Components**: Use existing card structure from `src/components/cards/StreamCard.tsx`
6. **Error Handling**: Use existing error codes and normalization from `src/utils/error-codes.ts`

### Key Design Decisions

1. **Minimal Database Changes**: Only add recommendation_sessions cache table
2. **Reuse TMDB Tools**: Leverage existing comprehensive TMDB integration
3. **Session-Based Caching**: 24-hour cache with manual refresh capability
4. **Explainable AI**: Transparent scoring with breakdown rationales
5. **Progressive Enhancement**: Graceful fallbacks for cold-start users
6. **Performance First**: Use existing database indices and batch TMDB requests

### Testing Strategy

Each task should include:
- Unit tests for core algorithms and data transformations
- Integration tests for API endpoints and database operations
- Component tests for UI elements and user interactions
- Error scenario testing for fallback mechanisms

### Performance Considerations

- Batch TMDB API calls using existing append_to_response patterns
- Use existing database indices for efficient queries
- Implement intelligent caching to reduce API calls
- Add monitoring for recommendation generation times and success rates
