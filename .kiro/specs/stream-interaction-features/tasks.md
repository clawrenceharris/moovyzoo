# Stream Interaction Features - Implementation Plan

## Task Overview

This implementation plan creates comprehensive stream interaction functionality including join/leave actions on stream cards, dropdown menu options, synchronized video playback, and complete stream page layout with real-time features. The tasks build incrementally from database foundation through UI components to complete interactive watch party experiences.
