# Playback Synchronization - Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements real-time playback synchronization for streaming sessions, enabling synchronized YouTube video playback across all participants in a watch party. The system ensures that when a host controls playback (play, pause, seek), all participants' video players automatically sync to match the host's state, creating a true shared viewing experience with network lag compensation and robust error handling.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Host-Controlled Playback Broadcasting

**User Story:** As a stream host, I want my playback actions to be automatically broadcast to all participants so that everyone stays synchronized during the watch party.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I play the video THEN the system SHALL broadcast a "play" event with current timestamp to all participants
2. WHEN I pause the video THEN the system SHALL broadcast a "pause" event with current timestamp to all participants
3. WHEN I seek to a different time position THEN the system SHALL broadcast a "seek" event with the new timestamp to all participants
4. WHEN I adjust volume THEN the system SHALL NOT broadcast volume changes (participant-specific control)
5. WHEN I enter/exit fullscreen THEN the system SHALL NOT broadcast fullscreen state (participant-specific control)
6. WHEN broadcasting fails due to network issues THEN the system SHALL retry the broadcast and show connection status
7. WHEN multiple rapid actions occur THEN the system SHALL debounce broadcasts to prevent spam

### Requirement 2: Participant Playback Synchronization

**User Story:** As a stream participant, I want my video player to automatically sync with the host's actions so that I stay in sync with the group viewing experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the host plays the video THEN my player SHALL automatically play from the broadcast timestamp
2. WHEN the host pauses the video THEN my player SHALL automatically pause at the broadcast timestamp
3. WHEN the host seeks to a new position THEN my player SHALL automatically jump to the broadcast timestamp
4. WHEN I try to control playback as a participant THEN the system SHALL prevent my actions and show "host-controlled" messaging
5. WHEN sync events are received THEN the system SHALL apply them within 500ms for smooth synchronization
6. WHEN I'm significantly out of sync (>2 seconds) THEN the system SHALL perform an immediate resync
7. WHEN I join mid-session THEN my player SHALL automatically sync to the current host playback state

### Requirement 3: YouTube Player Integration

**User Story:** As a system, I need to integrate deeply with the YouTube player API so that I can control and monitor playback state for synchronization.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the YouTube player loads THEN the system SHALL obtain a player instance reference for control
2. WHEN player state changes occur THEN the system SHALL capture play, pause, and seek events from the YouTube API
3. WHEN applying sync commands THEN the system SHALL use YouTube API methods (playVideo, pauseVideo, seekTo)
4. WHEN getting current state THEN the system SHALL use YouTube API methods (getCurrentTime, getPlayerState)
5. WHEN the video is buffering THEN the system SHALL handle buffering states without breaking sync
6. WHEN the video ends THEN the system SHALL broadcast the end state to all participants
7. WHEN YouTube API errors occur THEN the system SHALL handle them gracefully and attempt recovery

### Requirement 4: Real-time Event Broadcasting

**User Story:** As a system, I need to broadcast playback events in real-time using Supabase so that all participants receive immediate sync updates.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a playback event occurs THEN the system SHALL use Supabase real-time channels for broadcasting
2. WHEN broadcasting events THEN the system SHALL include event type, timestamp, and video position data
3. WHEN participants subscribe THEN they SHALL receive events on the stream-specific channel
4. WHEN the database is updated THEN Supabase SHALL trigger real-time notifications to subscribers
5. WHEN connection is lost THEN the system SHALL attempt to reconnect and resync automatically
6. WHEN reconnecting THEN the system SHALL request current state from the host for immediate sync
7. WHEN multiple events occur rapidly THEN the system SHALL handle them in chronological order

### Requirement 5: Network Lag Compensation

**User Story:** As a participant with network latency, I want the system to compensate for delays so that I stay synchronized despite connection speed differences.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN applying sync commands THEN the system SHALL account for network transmission delays
2. WHEN time differences are small (<0.5 seconds) THEN the system SHALL ignore micro-adjustments to prevent jitter
3. WHEN time differences are moderate (0.5-2 seconds) THEN the system SHALL apply gradual sync corrections
4. WHEN time differences are large (>2 seconds) THEN the system SHALL perform immediate hard sync
5. WHEN buffering occurs THEN the system SHALL pause sync updates until playback resumes
6. WHEN connection quality is poor THEN the system SHALL increase sync tolerance to prevent constant corrections
7. WHEN sync drift is detected THEN the system SHALL provide periodic automatic resync requests

### Requirement 6: Host Transfer and Management

**User Story:** As a participant, I want the system to handle host changes gracefully so that playback control transfers smoothly when the original host leaves.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the current host leaves the session THEN the system SHALL automatically assign host status to the next participant
2. WHEN host transfer occurs THEN the new host SHALL gain playback control permissions immediately
3. WHEN host transfer occurs THEN all participants SHALL be notified of the change
4. WHEN the new host takes control THEN their current playback state SHALL become the sync reference
5. WHEN no participants remain THEN the system SHALL end the streaming session
6. WHEN the original host rejoins THEN they SHALL NOT automatically regain host status
7. WHEN manual host transfer is requested THEN the current host SHALL be able to assign a new host

### Requirement 7: Sync State Management and Recovery

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to handle sync failures and recovery gracefully so that temporary issues don't ruin the viewing experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN sync fails THEN the system SHALL display connection status indicators to users
2. WHEN connection is restored THEN the system SHALL automatically request current state and resync
3. WHEN participants request manual resync THEN the system SHALL provide a "sync now" button
4. WHEN sync state becomes corrupted THEN the system SHALL fall back to host's current state
5. WHEN YouTube player errors occur THEN the system SHALL attempt to reload and resync the player
6. WHEN database connection fails THEN the system SHALL queue sync events and replay them when reconnected
7. WHEN multiple sync conflicts occur THEN the system SHALL always prioritize the host's state as authoritative

### Requirement 8: Performance and Optimization

**User Story:** As a system, I need to optimize sync performance so that real-time synchronization doesn't impact video playback quality or user experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN broadcasting events THEN the system SHALL debounce rapid successive events to prevent spam
2. WHEN processing sync events THEN the system SHALL handle them asynchronously to avoid blocking video playback
3. WHEN storing sync state THEN the system SHALL use efficient database operations with minimal overhead
4. WHEN multiple participants are present THEN the system SHALL scale efficiently without performance degradation
5. WHEN sync events are frequent THEN the system SHALL implement rate limiting to prevent system overload
6. WHEN participants join/leave THEN the system SHALL update subscriptions efficiently without affecting others
7. WHEN cleanup is needed THEN the system SHALL properly dispose of event listeners and subscriptions

### Requirement 9: User Interface and Feedback

**User Story:** As a user, I want clear visual feedback about sync status so that I understand when I'm in sync and when there are connection issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I'm connected and in sync THEN the system SHALL show a green "Connected" indicator
2. WHEN connection is lost THEN the system SHALL show a red "Connection Lost" indicator with reconnect option
3. WHEN I'm a participant THEN the system SHALL show "Host Controlled" messaging on playback controls
4. WHEN sync is occurring THEN the system SHALL show brief sync indicators without being intrusive
5. WHEN I'm the host THEN the system SHALL clearly indicate my host status and control permissions
6. WHEN sync fails THEN the system SHALL provide actionable error messages and retry options
7. WHEN manual resync is available THEN the system SHALL provide an easily accessible sync button

### Requirement 10: Mobile and Cross-Platform Compatibility

**User Story:** As a mobile user, I want playback synchronization to work seamlessly across all devices so that I can participate in watch parties from any platform.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using mobile devices THEN sync functionality SHALL work identically to desktop
2. WHEN switching between portrait and landscape THEN sync state SHALL be maintained
3. WHEN the mobile app goes to background THEN sync SHALL pause and resume when returning
4. WHEN mobile network changes (WiFi to cellular) THEN the system SHALL reconnect and resync automatically
5. WHEN touch controls are used THEN they SHALL integrate properly with sync restrictions for participants
6. WHEN mobile browsers are used THEN YouTube player integration SHALL work across all supported browsers
7. WHEN device performance is limited THEN sync SHALL prioritize video playback quality over sync precision
