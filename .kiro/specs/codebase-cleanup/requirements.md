# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature focuses on cleaning up and improving the existing codebase based on the comprehensive code review of the Habitats feature. The primary goals are to eliminate code duplication, centralize common utilities, improve file organization, and reduce complexity while maintaining all existing functionality. This refactoring will improve maintainability, reduce technical debt, and establish better patterns for future development.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Centralize Duplicated Validation Logic

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all validation logic centralized in shared utilities, so that I can maintain consistent validation rules across the application without duplication.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN validation logic is needed THEN the system SHALL use centralized utility functions from `/src/utils/validation.ts`
2. WHEN UUID validation is required THEN the system SHALL use a single `isValidUUID` function instead of inline regex patterns
3. WHEN form validation is needed THEN the system SHALL use shared Zod schema utilities for common patterns
4. WHEN input sanitization is required THEN the system SHALL use centralized sanitization functions
5. IF validation logic exists in multiple places THEN the system SHALL consolidate it into the shared utilities

### Requirement 2: Extract and Centralize Access Control Logic

**User Story:** As a developer, I want access control logic centralized in a dedicated service, so that permission checks are consistent and maintainable across all features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN access control is needed THEN the system SHALL use a centralized `AccessControlService`
2. WHEN checking habitat permissions THEN the system SHALL use standardized permission methods
3. WHEN validating user roles THEN the system SHALL use consistent role checking functions
4. IF access control logic is scattered across services THEN the system SHALL consolidate it into the dedicated service
5. WHEN permission checks fail THEN the system SHALL return consistent error codes and messages

### Requirement 3: Optimize and Consolidate Hook Patterns with React Query

**User Story:** As a developer, I want similar hooks to share common logic through base hooks and utilize React Query for efficient data management, so that I can reduce code duplication, improve caching, and maintain consistent behavior patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating message-related hooks THEN the system SHALL use a base `useMessages` hook for shared functionality
2. WHEN implementing real-time features THEN the system SHALL use shared connection management logic
3. WHEN handling loading and error states THEN the system SHALL use consistent state management patterns
4. IF hooks share similar logic THEN the system SHALL extract common functionality into base hooks
5. WHEN hooks need data fetching THEN the system SHALL use React Query for caching, background updates, and optimistic updates
6. WHEN creating `useDiscussions` and `useHabitat` hooks THEN the system SHALL utilize React Query for efficient data management
7. WHEN data needs to be cached THEN the system SHALL use React Query's caching mechanisms instead of manual state management
8. WHEN data needs to be synchronized THEN the system SHALL use React Query's background refetching and invalidation strategies

### Requirement 4: Simplify Complex Service Methods

**User Story:** As a developer, I want large service methods broken down into smaller, focused functions, so that the code is easier to understand, test, and maintain.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN service methods exceed 50 lines THEN the system SHALL break them into smaller, focused functions
2. WHEN methods handle multiple concerns THEN the system SHALL separate data fetching, business logic, and data transformation
3. WHEN complex operations are performed THEN the system SHALL use helper functions with clear single responsibilities
4. IF service methods mix concerns THEN the system SHALL refactor them into focused, composable functions
5. WHEN error handling is complex THEN the system SHALL use dedicated error handling utilities

### Requirement 5: Improve File and Folder Organization

**User Story:** As a developer, I want consistent file and folder naming that follows established conventions, so that the codebase is easier to navigate and maintain.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating utility files THEN the system SHALL use kebab-case naming (e.g., `access-control.service.ts`)
2. WHEN organizing shared utilities THEN the system SHALL group related functions in appropriately named files
3. WHEN creating service files THEN the system SHALL follow consistent naming patterns with clear responsibilities
4. IF files contain mixed concerns THEN the system SHALL split them into focused, single-responsibility files
5. WHEN barrel exports are used THEN the system SHALL maintain clean import paths and proper re-exports

### Requirement 6: Implement Transaction Support for Multi-Step Operations

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper transaction handling for multi-step database operations, so that data consistency is maintained even when partial failures occur.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN performing multi-step database operations THEN the system SHALL use database transactions
2. WHEN operations can partially fail THEN the system SHALL implement proper rollback mechanisms
3. WHEN updating related data THEN the system SHALL ensure atomicity of the entire operation
4. IF database operations fail partially THEN the system SHALL rollback all changes and return appropriate errors
5. WHEN transaction errors occur THEN the system SHALL log the error and provide user-friendly feedback

### Requirement 7: Reduce Component Coupling and Improve Reusability

**User Story:** As a developer, I want components to be loosely coupled and highly reusable, so that they can be easily tested, maintained, and used across different contexts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN components need navigation THEN the system SHALL accept navigation handlers as props instead of directly using router
2. WHEN components handle external dependencies THEN the system SHALL use dependency injection patterns
3. WHEN components need data THEN the system SHALL receive data through props rather than fetching it internally
4. IF components are tightly coupled to specific contexts THEN the system SHALL refactor them to be more generic
5. WHEN components are reused THEN the system SHALL ensure they work correctly in different contexts

### Requirement 8: Establish Consistent Error Handling Patterns

**User Story:** As a developer, I want consistent error handling patterns across all services and components, so that errors are handled predictably and users receive appropriate feedback.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN errors occur in services THEN the system SHALL use consistent error normalization and mapping
2. WHEN handling async operations THEN the system SHALL implement proper error boundaries and recovery
3. WHEN database operations fail THEN the system SHALL provide meaningful error messages and recovery options
4. IF error handling is inconsistent THEN the system SHALL standardize it using established patterns
5. WHEN errors need logging THEN the system SHALL use centralized logging utilities with appropriate detail levels

### Requirement 9: Optimize Database Query Performance

**User Story:** As a developer, I want database queries to be optimized for performance, so that the application responds quickly and scales effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN fetching related data THEN the system SHALL use efficient joins instead of N+1 queries
2. WHEN aggregating data THEN the system SHALL use database-level aggregations instead of application-level calculations
3. WHEN querying large datasets THEN the system SHALL implement proper pagination and filtering
4. IF queries are inefficient THEN the system SHALL optimize them using database best practices
5. WHEN complex queries are needed THEN the system SHALL consider using database views or stored procedures

### Requirement 10: Maintain Backward Compatibility and Testing

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all refactoring to maintain existing functionality and be thoroughly tested, so that users experience no disruption during the cleanup process.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN refactoring code THEN the system SHALL maintain all existing public APIs and functionality
2. WHEN moving code THEN the system SHALL update all imports and references correctly
3. WHEN changing internal implementations THEN the system SHALL ensure external behavior remains unchanged
4. IF breaking changes are unavoidable THEN the system SHALL provide clear migration paths and deprecation notices
5. WHEN refactoring is complete THEN the system SHALL pass all existing tests and maintain code coverage levels
