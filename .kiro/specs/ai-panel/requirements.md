# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature adds an AI discussion sidebar to the application that provides users with an interactive chat interface for conversing with an AI assistant. The sidebar is accessible from any page via a floating action button (FAB) and slides in/out smoothly. The interface includes starter prompts to help users begin conversations, support for photo attachments in chat messages, and utilizes LangGraph.js for LLM integration to provide intelligent responses.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to access an AI discussion sidebar from any page, so that I can have conversations with an AI assistant without leaving my current context.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user is on any page of the application THEN the system SHALL display a floating action button (FAB) in the bottom right corner
2. WHEN a user clicks the FAB THEN the system SHALL slide in a chat sidebar from the right side of the screen
3. WHEN the sidebar is open THEN the system SHALL display a clean chat interface with proper branding colors
4. WHEN a user clicks outside the sidebar or presses escape THEN the system SHALL slide the sidebar out smoothly
5. WHEN the sidebar opens THEN the system SHALL show an empty chat history ready for new conversations if no previous conversation exists

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see starter prompts when I first visit the AI discussion page, so that I can quickly begin meaningful conversations without having to think of what to ask.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits the AI discussion page with no previous chat history THEN the system SHALL display a collection of starter prompts
2. WHEN a user clicks on a starter prompt THEN the system SHALL populate the chat input field with that prompt text
3. WHEN starter prompts are displayed THEN the system SHALL show at least 4-6 diverse prompt categories (creative, analytical, educational, etc.)
4. WHEN a user starts typing in the chat input THEN the system SHALL hide the starter prompts to focus on the conversation

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to send text messages in the chat interface, so that I can communicate with the AI assistant.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user types a message in the input field THEN the system SHALL allow text input up to a reasonable character limit
2. WHEN a user presses Enter or clicks the send button THEN the system SHALL send the message and display it in the chat history
3. WHEN a message is sent THEN the system SHALL clear the input field and prepare for the next message
4. WHEN messages are displayed THEN the system SHALL clearly distinguish between user messages and AI responses
5. WHEN the chat history grows THEN the system SHALL automatically scroll to show the latest messages

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to attach photos to my chat messages, so that I can ask the AI questions about images or share visual context.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks the photo attachment button THEN the system SHALL open a file picker for image selection
2. WHEN a user selects an image file THEN the system SHALL validate it is a supported image format (jpg, png, gif, webp)
3. WHEN an image is attached THEN the system SHALL display a preview of the image in the chat input area
4. WHEN a user sends a message with an attached image THEN the system SHALL include both the text and image in the chat history
5. WHEN an image is too large THEN the system SHALL resize or compress it to appropriate dimensions
6. WHEN a user wants to remove an attached image THEN the system SHALL provide a clear way to remove it before sending

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want to receive intelligent AI responses to my messages, so that I can have meaningful conversations and get helpful information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user sends a message THEN the system SHALL use LangGraph.js to process the request and generate a response
2. WHEN the AI is processing a response THEN the system SHALL show a loading indicator or typing animation
3. WHEN an AI response is received THEN the system SHALL display it in the chat history with proper formatting
4. WHEN an error occurs during AI processing THEN the system SHALL display a user-friendly error message
5. WHEN a user sends an image THEN the system SHALL pass the image to the AI for analysis and response

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want the chat sidebar to be responsive and well-designed with proper branding, so that I can use it comfortably on different devices and screen sizes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the sidebar on mobile devices THEN the system SHALL display a full-screen overlay optimized for mobile
2. WHEN a user accesses the sidebar on desktop THEN the system SHALL display a fixed-width sidebar (400px) that slides in from the right
3. WHEN messages contain long text THEN the system SHALL wrap text appropriately and maintain readability
4. WHEN the interface loads THEN the system SHALL use the MoovyZoo brand colors defined in globals.css (brand-red, brand-blue, brand-black, brand-grey)
5. WHEN users interact with buttons and inputs THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate hover and focus states using brand colors
6. WHEN the FAB is displayed THEN the system SHALL use the primary brand red color (--brand-red-45) with proper hover effects

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the AI integration to use LangGraph.js, so that we have a robust and flexible framework for managing AI conversations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application initializes THEN the system SHALL properly configure LangGraph.js with necessary API credentials
2. WHEN processing user messages THEN the system SHALL use LangGraph.js workflows to handle conversation flow
3. WHEN handling image inputs THEN the system SHALL utilize LangGraph.js capabilities for multimodal processing
4. WHEN errors occur in the AI pipeline THEN the system SHALL handle them gracefully through LangGraph.js error handling
5. WHEN the conversation requires context THEN the system SHALL maintain conversation history through LangGraph.js state management
